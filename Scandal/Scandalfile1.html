        <h1 style="font-weight:334;">Integrity on Trial: Ernst & Young's $100 Million Lesson in Ethics</h1>
        <p style="font-weight:334;">
            Ernst & Young (EY), one of the largest auditing firms in the world, has agreed to pay a hefty fine of $100
            <br>
            million after U.S. securities regulators discovered that many of its auditors had cheated on ethics exams.
            <br>
            These exams are essential for auditors to obtain or maintain their professional licenses. The firm was found
            <br>
            to have not done enough to prevent this cheating. <br>
        </p>
        <h2 style="font-weight:334;">What Happened?</h2>
        <ul type="disc">

            <li>Cheating on Ethics Exams: Hundreds of EY auditors were found to have cheated on ethics exams, which <br>
                are crucial for ensuring that they uphold professional standards. This cheating occurred between 2017
                <br>
                and 2021. <br>
            </li>
            <li>
                Largest Fine Ever: The $100 million penalty is the largest ever imposed by the Securities and Exchange
                <br>
                Commission (SEC) on an auditing firm. This is significant because auditing firms play a critical role in
                <br>
                verifying the accuracy of financial statements for companies and protecting investors from misleading
                <br>
                information. <br>
            </li>
            <li>
                Misleading Investigators: The SEC reported that EY misled investigators and withheld evidence during the
                <br>
                investigation. This behavior is particularly concerning because auditors are expected to maintain high
                <br>
                ethical standards. <br>

            </li>
            <li>Internal Complaints Ignored: EY received internal complaints about cheating but did not disclose this
                <br>
                information to the SEC initially. As the investigation progressed, it became clear that the cheating was
                <br>
                more widespread than initially thought. <br>
            </li>
            <li>Specific Incidents: The SEC found that 49 auditors received the answers to an ethics exam required for
                <br>
                becoming certified public accountants. Additionally, many other employees cheated on continuing <br>
                education exams necessary for maintaining their licenses. <br>
            </li>
            <li>Reasons for Cheating: Some employees admitted to cheating due to heavy work commitments or repeated <br>
                failures to pass the exams.
            </li>


        </ul>
        <h2 style="font: weight 334px;">EY's Response</h2>
        <p style="font: weight 334px;">EY acknowledged that its actions were wrong and emphasized the importance of <br>
            integrity and ethics in its operations. The firm stated that sharing answers on exams violates its Code of
            <br>
            Conduct and that it would enhance its efforts to enforce ethical compliance. <br>
        </p>
        <h2 style="font: weight 334px;">Background Context</h2>
        <p style="font: weight 334px;">
        <ul type="disc">
            <li>>Historical Issues: This is not the first time EY has faced scrutiny for cheating. A similar scandal
                <br>
                occurred from 2012 to 2015, which the firm managed internally without external intervention. <br>
            </li>

            <li>Regulatory Oversight: The SEC has been closely monitoring accounting firms since the collapse of Enron
                <br>
                in 2001, which highlighted the need for strict ethical standards in auditing. Following that scandal,
                <br>
                Congress established the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) to oversee audit firms and
                <br>
                enforce compliance with ethical rules.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h2 style="font: weight 334px;">Future Actions</h2>
        <p style="font: weight 334px;">
        <ul type="disc">
            <li>As part of the settlement, EY will hire two independent consultants. One will review the firm's ethics
                <br>
                policies, and the other will investigate why the firm failed to disclose the cheating adequately. <br>
            </li>
            <li>
                The SEC's investigation is ongoing, which may lead to further actions against individuals involved in
                the <br>
                cheating. <br>
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h2 style="font: weight 334px;">Conclusion</h2>
        <p style="font: weight 334px;">The SEC's settlement with EY sends a strong message that integrity failures by
            <br>
            independent auditors will not be tolerated. The case highlights the importance of ethical behavior in the
            <br>
            auditing profession, as these firms are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of financial information that
            <br>
            investors rely on.</p>
