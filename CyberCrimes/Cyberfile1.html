        <h1>A Clever Hack in GitHub Pages: How a Researcher Turned a Simple Bug into a $4,000 Bounty</h1>
        <p>
        <p> Imagine being able to make someone else's website run any code you want—just by getting them to click on a
            link. It sounds like something out of a spy movie, but that's exactly what security researcher Joren
            Vrancken did on GitHub, one of the largest platforms for hosting code. </p>

        <p> GitHub offers a feature called GitHub Pages, which allows developers to create and host websites directly
            from their code. It’s a handy way to turn code into a working website. But Vrancken found a vulnerability in
            this feature that could let an attacker run harmful code and gain access to private repositories.
        </p>
        Here’s how it happened:
        </p>
        <h2>The Vulnerability: How the Code Could Be Exploited</h2>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li>GitHub Pages uses a tool called Jekyll to help users build websites. The settings for Jekyll are stored
                in a configuration file, and GitHub automates tasks like managing website themes. When you choose a
                theme, GitHub makes changes to the site’s code, which requires special permissions.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Usually, only two directories—the root of a branch or the /docs folder—can be used for a GitHub Pages
                site. But Vrancken found that you could trick GitHub into using any directory by changing the theme
                chooser URL. This small change could make the build process run a tar command, which could then execute
                any code the attacker wanted.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The Real Danger: Tricking Admins</h2>
        <p>
        <p>
            While this might not seem like a big deal at first—since the attacker needed special permissions—Vrancken
            figured out a way to make it more dangerous. By creating a malicious URL, an attacker could trick an admin
            into clicking on it using phishing or other social engineering tactics. Once the admin clicked the link and
            chose a theme, the attacker's code would run, potentially revealing private data from the repository.</p>

        <p><em>The scary part? The attacker wouldn’t need a GitHub account or any connection to the target
                repository—just a
                well-crafted URL.</em></p>
        </p>

        <h2>The Response: Fixing the Issue and Rewarding the Researcher</h2>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li>Vrancken reported this vulnerability to GitHub on July 27th, and they responded the same day. By August
                23rd, GitHub had fixed the issue by removing the Theme Chooser functionality that allowed the exploit.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>For his work, Vrancken was awarded a $4,000 bug bounty and a GitHub Pro subscription. He said this was
                one of the more enjoyable bug bounties he’d worked on, comparing it to solving puzzles on Hack The Box,
                a popular cybersecurity challenge platform.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Why This Is Important</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>This story shows why bug bounty programs are so important. Companies like GitHub invite security
                researchers to find and report vulnerabilities before bad actors can exploit them. By fixing these
                issues, platforms become safer for everyone.</li>
            <br>
            <li>As Jill Moné-Corallo, GitHub’s director of product security engineering response, said: “Each submission
                to our bug bounty program is a chance to make GitHub, our products, and our customers more secure.”</li>
            <br>
            <li>
                So, next time you use a platform like GitHub, remember that people like Joren Vrancken are working hard
                behind the scenes to keep your code—and your data—safe.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Joren Vrancken's discovery of a security flaw in GitHub Pages shows how important it is to have sharp-eyed
            researchers keeping our online tools safe. By finding a way to run harmful code through a simple website
            feature, he highlighted a potential risk that could have affected many users. Thanks to his efforts, GitHub
            was able to fix the problem quickly, ensuring that their platform is safer for everyone. This story reminds
            us how valuable bug bounty programs are, where researchers like Vrancken help companies find and fix issues
            before they can be exploited by bad actors. </p>
