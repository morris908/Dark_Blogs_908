        <h1>Former Fundraiser Jack Olson Pleads Guilty in Omaha Corruption Scandal</h1>
        <p>
            In a significant development in a public corruption scandal in Omaha, Nebraska, Jack Olson, the former chief
            <br>
            fundraiser for the Omaha Latino Police Officers Association (LPOA), has officially entered a guilty plea.
            <br>
            This plea comes after a lengthy battle against the charges he faced alongside former police officers and a
            <br>
            former city councilman. <br>
        </p>
        <h2>Charges and Plea</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Charges: Olson pled guilty to two serious charges: </li>
            <li>Tax Evasion: Failing to file tax returns for four consecutive years.</li>
            <li>Conspiracy to Commit Wire Fraud: Involvement in a scheme to defraud donors.</li>
            <li>Sentencing Date: He is scheduled to be sentenced on November 5 in Lincoln, Nebraska.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Background of the Case</h2>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Co-defendants: Olson was arrested alongside former City Councilman Vinny Palermo and police officers
                <br>
                Richie Gonzalez and Johnny Palermo, all of whom also pled guilty to conspiracy charges.
            </li>
            <li>Potential Penalties: The conspiracy charge carries a maximum prison sentence of 20 years, while the <br>
                tax evasion charge could lead to five years in prison. However, as part of Olson's plea deal, his prison
                <br>
                sentence will not exceed 42 months.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Details of the Fraud</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Olson was accused of pocketing a significant portion of the funds he raised for the LPOA, keeping
                between 65% to 80% of all donations. </li>
            <li>He misled donors by claiming that 100% of the funds would support a police athletic league aimed at
                helping underprivileged youth. </li>
            <li>Total Amount Raised: Over a four-year period, Olson reportedly collected more than half a million
                dollars.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Tax Evasion Findings</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Tax Loss: The federal indictment revealed that Olson failed to file income tax returns for the <br>
                years 2018 through 2021, resulting in a federal tax loss of $95,705.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Restitution Ordered</h2>
        <ul>
            <p>As part of the plea agreement, Olson has been ordered to pay restitution to various parties:</p>
            <li>$27,111 to the Latino Peace Officers Association.</li>
            <li>Up to $30,883 to individual donors, with the exact amount to be determined at sentencing.</li>
            <li>$95,475 to the U.S. Department of the Treasury.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Jack Olson's guilty plea marks a significant turn in the ongoing investigation into public corruption in <br>
            Omaha. With sentencing approaching, the case highlights serious issues of financial misconduct and the <br>
            importance of accountability in fundraising efforts for community organizations.</p>
