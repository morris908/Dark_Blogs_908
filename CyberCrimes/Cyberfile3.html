        <h1>Large-Scale Extortion Campaign: How Hackers Exploited Exposed Files to Steal Data
        </h1>
        <p>
            Imagine leaving a key to your house under the doormat, thinking no one will find it. But what if someone did
            and used it to take your valuables? Something similar happened in a recent large-scale extortion campaign
            where hackers found and exploited exposed keys—or credentials—left out in the open by organizations.
        </p>
        <h2>What Happened?</h2>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li>Hackers targeted a type of file called a .env file, which is often used in web applications to store
                important information like passwords and access keys for cloud services and social media accounts. These
                files should be kept private, but in this case, they were accidentally left exposed on the internet,
                allowing anyone to access them.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Once the hackers found these exposed .env files, they used the information inside to break into the
                organizations' cloud services, like Amazon Web Services (AWS). From there, they launched further
                attacks, scanning millions of other websites and collecting even more sensitive information.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Scale of the Attack</h2>
        <p>

            The hackers were highly organized and targeted over 110,000 domains, successfully stealing more than
            90,000 pieces of sensitive data. This included cloud service credentials and social media account
            details. Instead of using traditional methods like exploiting security bugs, the attackers simply took
            advantage of the exposed files to get in.

        </p>

        <h2>What Did the Hackers Do?</h2>
        <p>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li>Stole Data: They copied sensitive information from cloud storage and left ransom notes, demanding
                payment to prevent them from selling the data on the dark web.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Sent Phishing Emails: They used stolen Mailgun credentials to send phishing emails from legitimate
                domains, making it harder for victims to detect the scam.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Attempted Cryptocurrency Mining: They also tried to use the compromised cloud services to mine
                cryptocurrency, but this attempt failed.
            </li>

        </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Why Does This Matter?</h2>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li>This attack highlights the dangers of accidentally exposing sensitive information online. The hackers
                didn't need to find complex security flaws; they simply exploited simple mistakes like leaving important
                files unprotected. It also shows how skilled and knowledgeable these attackers were, using advanced
                techniques to automate their attacks and spread quickly across the internet.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Hackers found and exploited exposed .env files containing important credentials, allowing them to break into
            cloud services, steal data, and demand ransom. This large-scale attack affected thousands of organizations,
            showing the importance of securing sensitive information and being aware of potential vulnerabilities.</p>
